What is OOP? List OOP concepts

As the name suggests, Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that use objects in programming, 
they use objects as a primary source to implement what is to happen in the code. Objects are seen by the viewer 
or user, performing tasks assigned by you. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like
inheritance, hiding, polymorphism etc. in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data
and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.
