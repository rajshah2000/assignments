    <p> Here's a basic outline of how form validation can be implemented in JavaScript: <br>
        1. HTML Form: Create an HTML form with input fields that users will fill out. <br>
        2. JavaScript Validation Function: Write a JavaScript function that will be triggered
        when the form is submitted. This function should perform validation checks on the form
        fields. <br>
        3. Validation Rules: Define validation rules for each form field. These rules can
        include checks for required fields, minimum and maximum lengths, specific formats (like
        email or phone number), and more. <br>
        4. Error Handling: Display error messages next to the form fields if validation fails.
        Error messages should inform users about what went wrong and how to correct it. <br>
        5. Prevent Default Submission: If validation fails, prevent the form from being
        submitted to the server. This allows users to correct their mistakes before submitting
        again.</p>
